# VSC---Preferences
My personal preferences and settings for Visual Studio Code - Frontend Dev


## Fonts
* Victor Mono - (Only for programming) -
* * It has beautiful ligatures and font styles.

## Theme 
* One Dark Pro
* * For now, it is the best theme for frontend dev
 
## Extension
* Console Ninja - I still have not tested it :(
* Error Lent - It shows the error with a good style and is easy to read.
* The other extension depends on the project.
